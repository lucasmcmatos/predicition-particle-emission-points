It begins by importing all necessary libraries for data manipulation, modeling, evaluation, and hyperparameter optimization. To ensure experimental reproducibility, we fix random seeds for Python, NumPy, and TensorFlow. We also configure TensorFlow to detect and utilize the GPU, if available, while limiting GPU memory allocation to avoid resource exhaustion — especially important during hyperparameter tuning.
